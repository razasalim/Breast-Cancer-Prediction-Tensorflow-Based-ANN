# Breast Cancer Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to build a custom artificial neural network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict outcomes for a specific application, in this case, breast cancer prediction.

## How the Code Works: 
Simply follow the steps in the code, and you will ultimately understand how it works.

## How to Run the Code:
- After downloading the 'BreastCancerPrediction_Tensorflow_Based_ANN.ipynb' code and the 'BreastCancerData.csv' dataset, update the file path for the dataset in the code. 
- This project uses external libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. Please ensure these libraries are installed before running the code.
